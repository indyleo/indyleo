# Hi, I'm Indyleo!

**Always Learning | Backend Developer | Tinkerer**

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

- **OS Preference:** Linux-first (Arch/Debian), but I work with Windows as well.
- **Languages I Use:** Go, Python, Lua, Shell, PowerShell, web languages, C/C++, and Zig
- **Currently Exploring:** Keyboards (as always), workflows, tools, and home servers
- **Tools I Like:** Neovim, Docker, Git, Alacritty, Floorp or Brave, and Oh My Posh
- **Fun Fact:** I sometimes get more excited about dotfiles than actual projects (though I find both fun).
