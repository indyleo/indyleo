# Hi, I'm Indyleo!

**Likes Learning New Skills | Backend Developer**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about building clean, efficient, and scalable software. Whether it’s scripting for automation, configuring systems, or developing full-blown applications, I enjoy solving real-world problems through code.

## About Me

- **OS Preference:** Linux-first (Arch/Debian), but I enjoy working on windows as well.
- **Languages I Use:** Go, Python, Lua, Shell, Powershell, Web Langs, C/C++, and zig
- **Currently Exploring:** Keyboards (Like always), Workflows, Tools, Home Servers
- **Tools I Like:** Neovim, Docker, Git, Alacrity, Floorp or Brave, and Oh My Posh
- **Fun Fact:** I sometimes get more excited about dotfiles than actual projects, though I find both fun.

## Projects

Here are a few things I’m working on or have built:

- **[My Kde Setup](https://github.com/indyleo/kdedots)** – A highly-tweaked config built with performance and aesthetic in mind.
- **[Tool Scripts](https://github.com/indyleo/scripts)** – Handy shell and scripts to make life easier.
- **[My Windows Setup](https://github.com/indyleo/WindowsStuff)** – A nice clean windows setup
